# Number Guessing Game
This is my submission for the number-guessing-game project on roadmap.sh
https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game

It fits all the listed project requirements and I plan to add the rest of the recommended features in the near future.

Current features:
* Difficulty selection (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* Hints after each guess ('higher' or 'lower').
* Tracks and displays number of guesses.
* Tracks and displays time taken to guess.

Planned features:
* Highscore tracking
* Optional extra hint before guessing
